# SSRT Calculation

SSRTs can either be calculated:

- Using a Mean estimation (M\_{RT} - M\_{SSD})
- Utilising the RT distribution of correct Go Trials in a
  to estimate the Stop-Signal Reaction Time.

Since the 2nd approach uses an integrative procedure that estimates the SSRT
from the RT distribution using p(response | signal); in cases where p(response
| signal) == 50%, both estimates should produce identical results.
